# Exercises sessions

1. Reminder about the gaussian distribution and introduction to decision making. Exercises on sequential ratio probability test (SPRT) that brings the notion of likelihood and ends up with a process of decision making. Possibility to add slightly more complex models using urgency-gating etc... In this case, one try to estimate a non-varying binary random variable.
Example : Decision making task in which the subject/animal has to decide the moving direction of a patch of point.

2. This second session introduces the notion of prior (ie. we know the rules that steer the system) and how to mix them with likelihood. In this session, we will introduce bayes' theorem and optimal combination of prior and likelihood using hidden markov models. We will consider the same binary RV as in session 1 except that, in this second session, it will be time varying. The dynamic of the system will be controlled by switch probabilities between the 2 potential states. 
Example : Same as before except that in this case, the state can change over time.

3. This third session will be about continuous time varying random variable which is not fully observable (for example, assessing the position of your limb while performing a movement). We will use an optimal combination of prior and likelihood (aka, Kalman filter) as before except that in this case, the RV can take an infinity of possible values.
At this end of this session, we can add the EM algorithm which is very nice.

4. Application of the Kalman filter to "real life" data (collect data from previous experiment - see NMA").
