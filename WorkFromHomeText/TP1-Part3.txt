# Part 3 : Drift diffusion model with fixed threshold


The thresholding stopping rule define a desire error rate and will continue making measurements until that error rate is reached. Experimental evidence suggested that evidence accumulation and thresholding stopping strategy happens at neuronal level (see [this article](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.113038?journalCode=neuro) for further reading).

In this exerise, we will use thresholding as our stopping rule and observe the behavior of the DDM. 

With thresholding stopping rule, we define a desired error rate and will continue making measurements until that error is reached. Experimental evidence suggested that evidence accumulation and thresholding stopping strategy happen at neuronal level.

Mathematically speaking, the threshold is defined based on the likelihood ratio that has been computed before. We define the error rate $\alpha$ that we want to accept. Based on the properties of probability, we have the following definition of thresholds:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
th_L = \log \dfrac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} & = & -th_R\\
th_R = \log \dfrac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} & = & -th_L
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Implement the function *threshold_DDM* whose signature is given below :
