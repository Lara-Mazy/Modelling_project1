When we try to estimate the exact position of our gaze or limb based on sensory inputs (vision, proprioception),
we always end up with an erroneous estimate. This means that, even though we have perfectly working sensory inputs,
they are influenced by noise and therefore the inferred state will be a noisy approximation of the real latent
state. For example, if the exact position of the tip of your fingernail in a given cartesian space is [2 cm, 3cm],
you might end up with an estimate which is [1.95 cm, 3.07 cm] when you rely on sensory input to find it.
