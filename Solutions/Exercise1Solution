  Author: Antoine de Comite 
  This function computes the gaussian distribution characterised by mu & sigma on the set x_vector
  
  Inputs : x_vector (numpy array) the set over which you want to compute the gaussian distribution
           mu (double) mean value of the gaussian distribution
           sigma (double) standard deviation of the gaussian distribution
  Outputs: px (numpy array) is the gaussian distribution evaluated over x_vector
  """
  
  px = 1/(np.sqrt(2*np.pi*sigma**2)) *np.exp((-(x_vector-mu)**2)/(2*sigma**2))
  return px
